Iâ€™m pretty sure we have all had or heard of the debate between which 
movie superhero franchise is the best, DC or Marvel. This is why 
I chose to look into this topic using a dataset I found on Kaggle. 
I have had many discussions and debates among friends about which 
franchise is the best.  However, I have not done an empiracle analysis.

<p>According to the numbers above, Marvel Movie studio wins in every category.  Although I was expecting this,
I did not think some of these numbers would be so drastically appart.  Maybe Marvel Studio is so far ahead because 
they simply make more movies than DC.</p>

<h4><b>Some interesting facts:</b></h4>

<p>One of the critical characteristics of the Marvel comic universe is that their characters/ heroes are more likely 
to struggle. This is seen in their movies, comics, and TV shows, which focus on the struggles that these heroes are 
going through more often than not (due to Marvel's realistic style). They also tend to be born like ordinary people 
who undergo accidents and transformations to gain their power. Peter Parker was just an ordinary kid who was bitten 
by a radioactive spider and gained the powers of Spiderman. However, Bruce Banner is not born with his ability (the Hulk). 
But instead, he transforms into him from time to time because of exposure to gamma rays. Captain America was a skinny kid
 from Brooklyn who was turned into 'Cap' by the super-soldier serum.</p>
 <p>In contrast to the Marvel roster, the DC heroes tend to be born great. They have magical powers, mystical origins, 
 or they were born into a wealthy family. Superman was sent to Earth by his father Jor-El from Krypton with extraordinary 
 abilities and given human parents on Earth, so he could be raised as an average person who would not know of the planet's 
 destruction until it is too late. Wonder Woman is also a demi-god who was raised on the island of Themyscira by her mother,
 Queen Hippolyta and trained to be an Amazonian warrior. Batman is also born at Wayne Manor with his parents Thomas and Martha, 
 but he has no superpowers or abilities; instead, he possesses great wealth. Aquaman is born from the Atlantean King, who inherited
 his power. Even Cyborg was a great college footballer. For the majority of DC characters, life tends to have come with many advantages.</p>

<h4><b>Who has the strongest heroes?</b></h4>

<p>When considering who has the strongest superheroes between the 2 we need to consider the most powerful Marvel characters alongside
 the most powerful DC Characters. While you might be thinking Captain Marvel V's Superman or Hulk v's Aquaman. In truth, both the Marvel
 and DC Universe have a wide range of entities that are far more powerful than the 'roster' of heroes and villains that you might commonly
 know. Probably the 2 heaviest hitters are Marvel's Protege and DC's The Presence. The Presence is basically the God of the DC Universe while
 Protege is a cosmic entity that can mimic many other entities powers. So, he could have powers equal to anyone or anything. Which is a weird
 twist that means that he can equal the power of any DC Character in our hypothetical battle. So, for lack of a better word, generally speaking,
 a fighting battle between rosters would probably be a draw in terms of power/ strength.</p>
